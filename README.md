UPDATE: now master has C++ code with partial FS support and partly-moved abstraction model. Old master renamed to old_c_master

Branches old_c_master and fs_fat32 contain old and stable (in terms of this project :) ) C code

BUT abstraction2 and work (mostly work, all new code is there) contain experimental C++ code, which will replace master after I finish this (to support processes and FS)
